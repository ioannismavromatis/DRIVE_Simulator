% usage
%   [route, dist] = ROUTE_PLANNER(dg, S, T)
%
% input
%   dg = directed graph of road network
%      = [N x N] matrix
%        (element i,j is non-zero when the connection between nodes
%         i->j exists). Use the connectivity_matrix returned by function
%        extract_connectivity.
%   S = route source (start) node
%     = node index (int)
%   T = route target (destination) node
%     = node index (int)
%
% output
%   route = matrix of subsequent nodes traversed
%   dist = total distance covered by route, counting as unit distance a
%          transition between nodes (Remark: this is NOT the actual
%          distance over the map for this route).
