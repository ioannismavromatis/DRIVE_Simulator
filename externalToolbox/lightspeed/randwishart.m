function cholX = randwishart(a,d)
%RANDWISHART    Sample from Wishart distribution.
%
% cholX = RANDWISHART(A,D) returns a DxD upper triangular matrix such that
% cholX'*cholX is a sample from a Wishart distribution with shape parameter
% A and unit scale.
%
% The probability density function has the form:
% p(X) = |X|^(a-(d+1)/2)*exp(-tr(X))/Gamma_d(a)
% where Gamma_d is the multivariate Gamma function.
