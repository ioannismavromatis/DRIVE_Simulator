function [density,test] = hhist(data, resolution)
% HHIST       Locally-adaptive unbiased density estimate.
%
% hhist(data) plots a density estimate of p(data).
% hhist(data,resolution) increases the resolution of the plotted curve.
% density = hhist(data,resolution) returns the density estimate instead of 
% plotting it.  length(density) == resolution.
% [density,test] = hhist(data,resolution) also returns the locations at which
% the density was evaluated.
%
% The algorithm is linear interpolation of the empirical cumulative 
% distribution.  Reference:

% A tricky aspect of this algorithm is that it is not enough to simply 
% evaluate the density at the test locations.  If you do that, you may miss
% sharp spikes.  Instead, you must compute the average density around each
% test location.

% Algorithm to evaluate the density at test locations only: 
% 1. Compute the slope of the cdf between consecutive input points.
%    For the last point, the slope is zero.
% 2. For each test location, find the nearest input point which is smaller.
%    This is cleverly done via the interp1 function.
% 3. Use the previously computed slope as the density at that test location.

% g(i) = slope of the cdf between data(i) and data(i+1)
g = [0; 1./diff(data); 0; 0];
% extend data so that interp1 doesn't fail
% note mind < min(data), maxd > max(data)
datax = [mind; data; maxd];
index = [0; cumsum(count); 0];
test_index = floor(interp1(datax,index,test));
density = g(test_index)/(length(data)+1);
end

% Algorithm to compute the average density around each test location:
% 1. Find the borders of the nearest-neighbor cell for each test location.
% 2. Evaluate the cdf at the border locations.
% 3. Use the cdf slope between borders as the density for the test location.
test = test(:);
border = [mind; (test(1:end-1) + test(2:end))/2; maxd];
% extend data so that interp1 doesn't fail
% note mind < min(data), maxd > max(data)
datax = [mind; data; maxd];
index = [0; cumsum(count); 0];
border_cdf = interp1(datax,index,border);
% this prevents the estimate from extending beyond the data limits.
border_cdf(border<min(data)) = 1;
border_cdf(border>max(data)) = n;
%plot(border,border_cdf)
density = diff(border_cdf)./diff(border)/(n-1);
